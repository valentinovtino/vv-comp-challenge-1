In my HTML file you'll find a collection of containers. Each container, representing each card, hold to more containers to seperate the two section of the card--the image and text. 


In my CSS file you'll find of of my styling. I did you CSS to declare my card's images but HTMl for the icons.

When it comes to styling, I did stuggle with positioning my items and text in the bottom half of the cards.
